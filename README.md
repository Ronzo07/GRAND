# GRAND
VHDL Verilog code for the Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND)

# Description
In this project we implemented the Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) in VHDL Verilog in two versions: soft and hard. GRAND algorithm is a methodology used to recover signals that are corrupted. For more info about GRAND kindly visit: [GRAND MIT](https://www.granddecoder.mit.edu/). Soft Grand is a more sophisticated version that takes into consideration the probobility associated with Noise on each bit.
